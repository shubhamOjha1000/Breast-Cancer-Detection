# Breast Cancer Detection

- **Motivation**:- Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of women each year and affecting countries at all levels. It impacts 2.1 million women each year, and also causes the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women. If it is diagnosed in early stages, the chances of survival are higher. The detection of the pattern of symptoms using machine learning is a very important technique to correctly understand hidden patterns.

- **OBJECTIVES**:-  
     - Achieve a higher level of accuracy in prediction.
     - Create our own hybrid algorithm by combining meta learning and neural network.
     - Comparison of various models with our own hybrid model.
     - Create an interface where numeric data is entered, and the algorithm predicts for breast cancer.
